# üîß Backend Testing Instructions

## Issue Summary
The backend is still expecting a `role` parameter even though we've removed it from the loginSchema.

## Next Steps - PLEASE DO THIS MANUALLY:

### 1. Open a NEW terminal/PowerShell window

### 2. Navigate to the backend directory:
```powershell
cd C:\Users\bssam\SmartSchedule\backend
```

### 3. Start the backend in the FOREGROUND (so you can see logs):
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### 4. **KEEP THAT TERMINAL OPEN** and watch the logs

### 5. In a SECOND terminal, test the login:
```powershell
Invoke-WebRequest -Uri http://localhost:3001/api/auth/login -Method POST -ContentType "application/json" -Body '{"email":"student@demo.com","password":"TestPassword123!"}' -UseBasicParsing
```

### 6. Look at the FIRST terminal (where the backend is running)

You should see logs like:
```
üîç ==> Login endpoint hit!
üîç Login request body: {"email":"student@demo.com","password":"TestPassword123!"}
üîç Login schema keys: ['email', 'password']
```

### Expected Outcomes:

**If you DON'T see these logs:**
- The request is NOT reaching our login endpoint
- There's middleware or another route intercepting it
- Please copy and send me ALL the output from the backend terminal

**If you DO see these logs + an error:**
- The loginSchema validation is the problem
- Please copy and send me the exact error message

## Alternative: Check if there's an old backend running

Run this to see all Node processes:
```powershell
Get-Process -Name node | Select-Object Id, ProcessName, Path
```

If you see multiple node processes, kill them all:
```powershell
taskkill /F /IM node.exe
```

Then try starting the backend again.

## Questions to Answer:

1. Do you see the üîç log messages when you make the login request?
2. What is the EXACT error message in the backend terminal?
3. What is the response from the Invoke-WebRequest command?

Please run these steps manually and send me the output!
